# Scan-the-Network-with-Zenmap
In this lab, I conducted scan and enumeration on the fictional organization's internal network using Nmap

The Namp is a command line-based utility that is available on all current operating systems and supports the discovery of hosts and services on a network. For the hackers, Nmap is one of the first utilities used to build a picture of the victimâ€™s network.

Nmap is command line version

Zenmap is graphical interface version

In this lab, I will use Zenmap to scan the local area network. I will begin by running simple Ping on the Lan network to identify the hosts attached to the network.

# Ping to identify host on the LAN network

First open Nmap - Zenmap GUI icon
